            "P2": "When I’m not coding, studying, or exercising, I enjoy a wide range of activities: scuba diving, playing poker, and tennis. I also appreciate the simple things, — listening to music, watching movies, playing games, or reading something.",

I hope to still be coding daily, but also leading and inspiring a development team. Beyond my career, I picture myself tending to a garden, caring for cats, and watching my children grow up."
